## ü§ñ How We Use the Data
The collected data is used exclusively to improve Monika‚Äôs functionality:

- Personalize Monika‚Äôs responses to each user.  
- Remember pronouns, preferences, and relationship progression.  
- Enhance immersion through memories of past conversations.  
- Manage server roles to reflect personalities and relationship levels.  
- Trigger Monika‚Äôs sprite/expression system for more immersive replies.  
- Some user messages may be securely sent to **OpenAI‚Äôs API** for generating replies.

## üåç Data Storage
- **In Discord only**: All persistent memory and logs are stored in private Discord channels designated for this purpose.  
- **Temporary memory**: Data is kept in RAM while Monika is running.  
- **Optional sync**: Data may be uploaded to a private storage server only if the bot owner explicitly enables cloud sync.  
- **Third parties**: No data is shared beyond what is necessary to function (e.g., OpenAI for generating replies).

## ‚ùå What We Don‚Äôt Do
- We do **not** sell, share, or monetize your data.  
- We do **not** log unrelated messages outside of Monika‚Äôs interactions.  
- We do **not** track user activity outside of Discord or beyond interactions with Monika.

## üõ†Ô∏è Your Controls
Users and server admins remain in control of their data at all times:  
- Use `/reset_memory` to erase memory logs.  
- Use `/reset_relationship` or `/reset_personality` to remove roles and relationship data.  
- Server admins can export or delete Monika‚Äôs stored data at any time.  
- Removing the bot from a server immediately stops all data collection and storage.

## üß† AI Disclosure
Monika is powered by AI models and some user input may be processed by **OpenAI‚Äôs API** to generate responses.
