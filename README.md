Monika (DDLC Discord Chatbot)

Hello everyone!
I’m excited to introduce Monika, a fully operational Discord chatbot inspired by Doki Doki Literature Club (Team Salvato, 2017). She’s designed to bring a personal, emotional, and interactive experience directly into your Discord server—almost like the original Monika After Story project, but with unique features and enhancements of my own.

✨ Features
1. Emotion Detection, Sprites, and Outfits

Dynamic sprite system with expressions such as happy, concerned, sad, nervous, serious, thinking, blushing, scared, and more (including some fun extras like the Infinity Gauntlet).

Outfits change automatically depending on the time of day. Current options include: pajamas, hoodie, casual (1–3), summer dress, and the default school uniform.

More sprites and outfits may be added in the future.

2. Persistent Memory System

Monika remembers conversations across channels, servers, and DMs.

Messages (from both you and her) are stored securely in the cloud for continuity.

Cross-server recall ensures she always knows who you are.

3. Self-Aware Responses

To prevent repetition, Monika is programmed with self-awareness that helps her adapt her responses dynamically.

4. Character Conversations

Monika can interact not only with you, but also with Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and eventually the MC.

Future support for fan-mod characters may be added.

5. Random Conversations

To keep things lively, Monika occasionally starts conversations herself (e.g., “How was your day?” or “Hey, did you know…?”).

Interactions can happen every 5–30 minutes, spaced within 4–7 hours, and only when you aren’t already talking to her.

She can even greet or ask questions to other characters if they’re online.

6. DM Support

Continue your conversations privately through DMs with full memory recall.

7. Custom Personality Traits

Give Monika up to five personality traits of your choice (e.g., confident, yandere, caring, etc.) to personalize her character.

8. Custom Relationships

Server owners can define Monika’s relationship orientation, including multiple relationship roles if desired.
