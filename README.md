# Monika
Hello Everyone of DDLC fans, I'm proud to say that this DDLC Monika(chatbot) is now working and operational.
Almost like with shapes.inc Monika, but with additional things and tweaks of my own.

Here are all the features you should or need to know:

 1. Emotion Detection, Mapping, Display, and Prompting:
*I have gone through the web and got some sprite cannon or not, and I have gotten some sprites of the following: happy, concerned, scared, sad, nervous, serious, thinking, blushing, a gun, and even the Infinity Gauntlet. all range from school uniform, casual 1, 2, and 3, pajamas, hoodie, and white dress. more sprite/expressions might be added in the near future.*

*her outfits changes depending on the time*

*her outfits are: pajamas, hoodie, 3 casuals, white summer dress, and her default school uniform*

 2. Memory System, Logging, Cross-Channel/Servers Memory Recall:
*I have made sure that she can remember you from different channel and server that this bot is in. and she can remember the messages you and her sends.(plus certain chatbots) though of you are wondering "where her memories being stored." they are on the cloud constantly updating*

 3. Self-Awareness in Replies:
*To make sure she doesn't say the same thing over and over she self-awareness when she replies to you.(and certain chatbots)*

 4. Allow Conversations Between Bots:
*not only can Monika talk with the user but she talk with Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and eventually MC.*

*She can't talk to others chatbot for now.(Unless you guys want me to but only characters from the DDLC's fan mods but I am thinking about it, just say the name)*

 5. strike up a random conversation from time to time:
*I made this one so things can a little bit more interesting. from time to time Monika will begin to ask a question or make a random conversation like: "how was your day?" or "hey user, did you know about this?". don't worry its every 5-30 minutes its completely random and will happen in 4-7 hours. but only when you are not talking to her. and it only goes to one channel that she has access to like #monika or #monika-chatbot. and if you do talk to her the timer will restart. but its not just the user, it also implies to the bots too. for explain if she said "good morning @Sayori, how are you feeling." or "Hey @Yuri, can you help me with this?". if they are there and the ones that are online, idle or Do Not Disturb, if you are offline it will not work.*

*for those of you are wondering "why make her strike up a random conversation?", will its to make the bot and the channels that she is on more interesting and less empty. instead of you making the conversation, she make a conversation. and yes there is a command for it.*

 6. conversation in the DM's:
*Instead of talking or chatting with Monika in the servers channels you can DM her and pick up your conversation from there.*

 7. customs personalities traits:
*you can now give Monika the personality you want instead of just default(the one we all know and love), you can give her up to 5 personality traits how ever you want.*

example: *confident, yandere, smart, and much more.*

 8. customs relationships:
*Monika can now be in a relationship of your choosing(if you are the owner). or you can make her be in one than one relationship*

 Commands:

`idlechat true/false` - enabled/disabled me to random talking. (side note: you have to wait 10 minutes to used this command again)

`reset_memory` - Clear her memory for this channel.

`reset_server` - Clear all memories for the server.

all commands are admin only to prevent people from change constantly.

the only once that isn't a admin command these:

`report <message>` - report if theres any bugs/errors

`export_memories` - Export all stored memory into a .txt file.

`helpme` - Get help about all of her commands.

`check_relationship` - this is to help check on the bond/relationship you have with her.

Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and MC are being worked on, you will see them soon.

note: She may be a little slow when she reply but when reply the second time it goes normal.
