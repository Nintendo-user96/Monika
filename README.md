# Monika
Hello Everyone of DDLC fans, I'm proud to say that this DDLC Monika(chatbot) is now working and operational.
Almost like with shapes.inc Monika, but with additional things and tweaks of my own.

Here everything you take to know:

 1. Emotion Detection, Mapping, Display, and Prompting:
*I have gone through the web and got some sprite cannon or not, and I have gotten some sprites of the following: happy, concerned, scared, sad, nervous, serious, thinking, blushing, and even a gun. more sprites will be added soon.*

 2. Memory System, Logging, Cross-Channel/Servers Memory Recall:
*I have made sure that she can remember you from different channel and server that this bot is in. and she can remember the messages you and her sends.(plus certain chatbots) though of you are wondering "where her memories being stored." I have sorted in a discord channel for the meantime until I found alternative solution for them to be stored. And also if you guys want to continue in a conversation in a different channel/server will you can.*

 3. Self-Awareness in Replies:
*To make sure she doesn't say the same thing over and over she self-awareness when she replies to you.(and certain chatbots)*

 4. Allow Conversations Between Bots:
*Yes. If make a channel with Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and eventually Ive(Cannon name base of my researched). for those of you think that Meiji is it real Cannon name. I don't blame you, I thought that was his Cannon name too, until I looked it up.*

*She can't talk to others chatbot for now.(Unless you guys want me to but only characters from the DDLC's fan mods but I am thinking about it, just say the name)*

 5. strike up a random conversation from time to time:
*I made this one so things can a little bit more interesting. from time to time Monika will begin to ask a question or make a random conversation like: "how was your day?" or "hey user, did you know about this?". don't worry its every 5-30 minutes its completely random and will happen in 4-7 hours. but only when you are not talking to her. and it only goes to one channel that she has access to like #monika or #monika-chatbot. and if you do talk to her the timer will restart. but its not just the user, it also implies to the bots too. for explain if she said "good morning @Sayori, how are you feeling." or "Hey @Yuri, can you help me with this?". if they are there and the ones that are online, idle or Do Not Disturb, if you are offline your safe.*

*for those of you are wondering "why make her strike up a random conversation out of nowhere?", will its to make the bot and the channels that she is on more interesting. instead of you making the conversation, she make a conversation. and yes there is a command for it.*

 Commands:
`/idlechat off - on` - enabled/disabled me to random talking. (side note: you have to wait 10 minutes to used this command again)
`/idlechat set <min> <max>` - changed the timer when I random talking.
`/reset_memory` - Clear her memory for this channel.
`/reset_server` - Clear all memories for the server.
all commands are admin only to prevent people from change constantly.

the only one that isn't a admin command is:
`/status` - Check if she is awake.

Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and Ive are being worked on, you will see them soon.

 Bugs:
*the commands will show in the commands list but still works.*

If there any bugs, error's, or ideas you guys want me to add. you can DM me or just say it on the server so we all know.
